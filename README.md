# What's new in Python3?

> :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Jupyter notebooks illustrating “What's new in Python3?”


## What is this?

I planned to dive into the “What's new …” documents of the Python3 releases for some time now.
Anyway, this is a “show me the code” version of that effort, in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
That means you can explore those features further, directly in the text.

They touch any *interesting* topic. In the scope of this repository,
I'm defining what counts as interesting. ☺

And these are the notebooks:

* **WIP** [Python 3.4](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jhermann/whats-new-in-python3/blob/master/python_3.4.ipynb)
* **TODO** [Python 3.5](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jhermann/whats-new-in-python3/blob/master/python_3.5.ipynb)
* **TODO** [Python 3.6](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jhermann/whats-new-in-python3/blob/master/python_3.6.ipynb)
* **TODO** [Python 3.7](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jhermann/whats-new-in-python3/blob/master/python_3.7.ipynb)
* **TODO** [Python 3.8](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jhermann/whats-new-in-python3/blob/master/python_3.8.ipynb)

Anything before 3.4 is contained in the first notebook.


## How to use the files in this repository?

An installation of the [1and1/debianized-jupyterhub](https://github.com/1and1/debianized-jupyterhub)
project is used to write and test these notebooks.
It gives you a fully working runtime environment on Debian-like platforms or in a Docker container,
with all extensions already installed.

Otherwise, look at the requirements within the `setup.py` of that project.
